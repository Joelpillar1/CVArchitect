## 📊 Impact Analysis

### What Users Can Do With 10 Credits:

**Before (3 credits):**
- Upload 1 resume (1 credit)
- 2 AI actions (rewrites, job matches, etc.)
- Very limited exploration

**After (10 credits):**
- Upload 1 resume (1 credit)
- Run resume analysis (1 credit)
- Try AI rewrites on multiple sections (2-3 credits)
- Generate job match analysis (1 credit)
- Optimize bullets (2-3 credits)
- Still have credits left to explore more features

|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Starting Credits | 3 | 10 | +233% |
| Resume Analyses | 3 | 10 | +233% |

## 🔍 Verification

### How to Verify the Changes:

1. **Database Verification:**
   ```sql
   -- Check new user subscriptions
   SELECT user_id, plan_id, credits, created_at
   FROM public.subscriptions
   WHERE plan_id = 'free'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   -- All new users should have 10 credits
   ```

2. **Application Verification:**
   - Sign up as a new user
   - Check Settings → Subscription
   - Should show 10 credits
   - Try AI features
   - Credit count should decrease correctly

3. **Feature Limits Verification:**
   - Use AI rewrites multiple times (should work up to 10 times)
   - Run resume analyses (should work up to 10 times)
   - Optimize bullets (should work up to 10 times)
